# Projects — Line Pipeline

Practice exercises for this lesson. Run each project with:

```bash
node starter/index.js < starter/sample.input
```

Validate in the UI with **Delivery → Run answer** (`starter/tests.json`).

## What you should practice

- `map` transforms every element into a new array of the same length
- `filter` keeps only elements passing a predicate and may shorten the array
- Neither `map` nor `filter` mutates the original array
- Higher-order functions take a callback describing the per-element behavior

## Folder conventions

- Projects live directly under `projects/` as `NNN-kebab-name/`
- Each project has `README.md` (PBL contract), `starter/index.js`, `starter/tests.json`, `starter/sample.input`, optional `solution/`
- Project numbers (`001`, `002`, …) are sequential within this lesson

## Project catalog

### 001-line-pipeline/

Apply `map` (uppercase) or `filter` (drop blanks) to a batch of stdin lines based on a selected operation.

## PBL contract checklist

Each project README must include (English headers):

- Problem context
- Goal
- Lesson concepts practiced
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Constraints
- Acceptance criteria
- Example data (if applicable)
- Suggested plan (no solution)
- Deliverables
- Extensions (optional)
